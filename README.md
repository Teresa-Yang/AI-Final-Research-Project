## Abstract
\normalsize
This study delves into the realm of chess position prediction, employing various machine learning algorithms to detect the outcomes of chess positions. The dataset, drawn from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as, "Chess (King-Rook vs King-Pawn)", encompasses attributes capturing diverse aspects of chess configurations, while the target variable signifies whether a particular position results in a win or loss. Leveraging the PyCaret library, the study systematically compares the performance of multiple classification models, evaluating key metrics like accuracy, area under the curve, precision, recall, and F1 score. Notably, the Decision Tree Classifier shows as the optimal model, showcasing the best accuracy and robust predictive capabilities across diverse metrics. The results provide interesting insights into how machine learning can help predict chess positions, shedding light on the potential implications for understanding the strategic moves that influence game outcomes.
